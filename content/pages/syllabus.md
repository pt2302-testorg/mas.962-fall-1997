Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Description
-----------

We use type on a daily basis without ever knowing much about its origins and craft. In this course we study the history and traditions of typography and their continuation into the digital domain. Weekly studio assignments will be given where students shall develop an intimate knowledge of typography and explore new directions in applications of digital technology in the context of typographic design.

Enrollment is limited to 15.

Obligatory Policy Statement
---------------------------

Working together on assignments is an efficient way to complete them, but your originality will suffer greatly.

Late Homework
-------------

Since the assignments build upon each successive installment, late homework will not be accepted. Under no circumstances will you receive credit for an assignment that is turned in late.
